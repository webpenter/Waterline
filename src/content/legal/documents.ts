/**
 * Built-in legal documents (§16.4: privacy, cookie and terms pages live
 * before launch; §16.3: the scraping prohibition is stated in the Terms).
 *
 * These are the shipped defaults: factual descriptions of what the platform
 * actually does (mirroring docs/privacy-procedures.md), each flagged for
 * review by counsel before launch. Editors can supersede any of them by
 * publishing a Page with the same slug — the CMS version then wins.
 * English-only by §13.9: legal text is never machine-translated; localized
 * versions are a counsel deliverable.
