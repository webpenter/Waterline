## The admission rule

Every listing on this site has verified direct water access: at least one
qualifying water access type (private beach, private dock, direct shore,
mooring, boathouse, slipway, quay, rock platform, riparian access or whole
island) and a distance to the water of 50 metres or less. "Sea view" and
"walking distance to the beach" are rejected. Listings publish structured
water data: metres of private frontage, berth length, depth at berth, beam,
bridge clearance and whether open water is reachable.

## Key sections

- [Search](${base}/en/search): the full inventory with water and boat filters.
- [Destinations](${base}/en/destinations): waterfront markets we cover.
- [Waterfront searches](${base}/sitemaps/landing.xml): curated landing pages, the indexable views of filtered inventory.
- [Journal](${base}/en/journal): editorial on mooring rules, tenure and waterfront ownership.
- [List with us](${base}/en/list-with-us): for agencies with qualifying inventory.
